            <P>This group of selectors includes pseudo-classes, which style certain states of an element.
              The :hover pseudo-class for example selects an element only when it is being hovered
              over by the mouse pointer:</P>

              as there's enough space and no other properties stating
              otherwise. You cannot adjust the height and width of these
              elements.

              Elements with a "postion:" property of "fixed" are positioned as fixed relative to the viewport. This
              means
              that the element will always stay in the same place, even if the page is scrolled. The element exists
              outside of the normal flow of the document.

              shrink
              and basis that allows the boxes to expand and contract.</p>

              to
              any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces.</p>
