              <h3>Pseudo-Class Selectors</h3>
              <p>Pseudo Class selectors can be appended to Element Selectors and enable elements to be targeted based on an aspect of
              their state. The syntax for a pseudo class selector is to append an element selector with a single colon followed by the
              specified state that the selector should target. They’re a good way of adding “dynamic” styling to elements without
              resorting to using JavaScript.</p>
