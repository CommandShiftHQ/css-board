              <p> A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer.</p>

              <h3>Padding</h3>
              <p>
                CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an
                element's content, inside of any defined borders.

              <h3>Display inline</h3>
              <p>
                Inline elements do not generate a line-break before or after
                themselves. The next element will be in the same line, as long
                as there's enough space and no other properties stating
                otherwise. You cannot adjust the height and width of these
                elements.

            <li class="post-it" id="tarndeep">
              <h3>Display Block</h3>
              <p>
                Displays an element as a block. It starts on a new line, and
                takes up the whole width of the line.

              <h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
              <p>
                Absolute Positioning is a web design technique that involves
                “breaking the grid” using absolute Positioning for elements.
                This helps create a unique and memorable design while offering a
                visually compelling user experience.
